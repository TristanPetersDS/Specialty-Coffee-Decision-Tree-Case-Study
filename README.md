# Specialty Coffee Decision Tree Case Study

## Overview
This project is a decision tree classification case study for a specialty coffee company. The goal is to analyze customer data and determine whether a strategic partnership with a Chinese coffee farm would be beneficial. 

By leveraging decision tree models and random forests, I explore key machine learning concepts such as entropy, gini impurity, model evaluation, and overfitting control.

## Dataset
The dataset includes customer attributes and purchasing behavior, which serve as the basis for model training and evaluation.

## Methodology
- **Data Preprocessing**
  - Importing and cleaning data
  - One-hot encoding categorical variables
  - Train-test split for supervised learning

- **Modeling**
  - Implementing Decision Trees (Gini & Entropy)
  - Controlling tree depth to prevent overfitting
  - Using Random Forests for improved accuracy

- **Evaluation**
  - Assessing model performance with accuracy scores
  - Comparing decision tree criteria (entropy vs. gini)
  - Exploring the impact of maximum depth on model generalization

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-Learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)
